# Steps for First Time Setup #

## 1. Install Development Tools ##

### Windows ###

On Windows, you'll need Cygwin, a Java JDK, and ant.

Cygwin is downloadable from http://www.cygwin.com/ or specifically: http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe

Of the packages, begin with the defaults, and add:
  * git - used for version control
  * make, gcc-mingw, and g++ - used to build arduino.exe (this will also pull in gcc-core)
  * perl - use this version, activestate or other distros have trouble
  * unzip, zip - for dealing with archives

Included in the defaults, but make sure:
  * coreutils (or textutils), gzip, tar

Not required but useful:
  * openssh - command line ssh client
  * nano - handy/simple text editor

And be sure to leave the option selected for 'unix line endings'

Download and install [ant](http://ant.apache.org/).  Add the apache-ant-xxx\bin directory to your path.

Download and install a Java JDK and point the JAVA\_HOME environment variable to its root directory.  An error message that reads "Unable to locate tools.jar. Expected to find  it in C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\lib\tools.jar" means you need to set JAVA\_HOME to your JDK (not JRE) installation.



### Mac OS X ###
On Mac OS X, install Apple's Developer Tools and git.

### Linux ###
On Linux, you need the Sun Java SDK, avr-gcc, avr-g++, avr-libc, make, ant, and git.


## 2. Grab the code from GitHub ##

this grabs the code as an anonymous user.

```
# grab the code, it'll take a while
git clone git://github.com/arduino/Arduino.git
# (maybe even a long while for you dialup and international folks)
```

## 3. Build It ##

Use the command line.

```
cd /path/to/arduino/build
ant

# if everything went well, you'll have no errors. (feel free to make
# suggestions for things to include here for common problems)

# then to run it
ant run

# each time you make a change, use ant to build the thing 
# and run to get it up and running. 
```

# Updating to the Latest Version #


Each time you want to update to latest version from svn:

```
cd /path/to/arduino
git pull
git update
```

If new folders have been added, or you're gettin odd errors, use:

```
ant clean
```
